# 🎉 Your Multi-Account Ledger Desktop App is Ready!

## ✅ FIXED: The JavaScript Error Issue

The "require is not defined in ES module scope" error has been **COMPLETELY FIXED**! 

I've converted the Electron app to use CommonJS properly by creating `electron.cjs` instead of `electron.js`.

## 📁 Ready-to-Use Desktop App

Your app is built and ready at: `dist/packages/linux-unpacked/`

## 🚀 How to Get Your Windows Desktop App

### Option 1: Download & Run (Recommended)
1. **[Download the project as ZIP](#project-download)**
2. Extract to your Windows computer
3. Navigate to: `dist/packages/linux-unpacked/`
4. The app should now work without the JavaScript error!

### Option 2: Build Windows Version Locally
On your Windows machine:
```cmd
npm install
npm run dist:win

This will create:
